# KNAB_Assignment
This Repository is for the KNAB assignment.
In the following days I will commit all the changes done to this repository.

## Table of Contents
- [The assignment](#Assignment)
- [Test plan](#Testplan)
- [How to use the framework](#Usage)

## Assignment
The assignment has 4 main deliverables:
-   Create a series of manual test cases that covers the CRUD operations on Trello board. Cover both positive & negative cases
-   Create test plan for the above created test cases. Approach to decide what needs to be tested at Back-End & Front-End
-   Perform CRUD operations on Trello board. Automate (at least three) of thepreviously created test cases for both UI and Back-End.
-   Provide a test report.

There are also 4 requirements:
-   Implement the solution using a BDD framework written in C#.
-   Setup the solution from scratch. Code should follow OOPs and design principles.
-   Upload the project into Github public repository and share the link with us at least2 days in advance.
-   The repository must include clear instructions on where to find each deliverable and how to execute the tests.

Because of the limited time before the intake I will start with the automated BDD framework in C# for both API and UI.


## Testplan
Because of the limited time the following steps will be done and commited to this repository:
- create a trello account and dashboard
- create a simple C# framework with Specflow, Selenium and RestSharp
- create the a simple API test and a simple UI test (POC)
- choose which tests will be made and what parts will be covered.
- make instructions how to use the framework
- make a test repot
